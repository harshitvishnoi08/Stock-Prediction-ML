# Stock Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning-based application for predicting stock prices using Python. It leverages libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to process data, build models, and visualize results.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares stock market data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifies trends and patterns in the data.
- **Model Building:** Implements and evaluates machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices.
- **Visualization:** Includes charts and graphs to showcase predictions and insights.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
